# KHQR Account Setup Guide

## Problem: "Account Not Found" Error When Scanning QR Code

If your QR code scans successfully and shows the amount, but ACLEDA shows "áž˜áž·áž“ážƒáž¾áž‰áž‚ážŽáž“áž¸" (Account not found), your Bakong account is **not properly set up to receive KHQR payments**.

## Solution: Set Up Your ACLEDA Account for KHQR

### Step 1: Verify Your Bakong Account Exists

1. Open your **ACLEDA Unity mobile app**
2. Go to **Profile** or **Settings**
3. Look for **Bakong ID** or **QR Code** section
4. Your Bakong ID should look like: `010925463@acleda`

### Step 2: Enable KHQR Receiving (CRITICAL)

**Option A: Through ACLEDA Unity App**
1. Open ACLEDA Unity app
2. Go to **QR Code** menu
3. Select **My QR Code** or **Receive Money**
4. You should see your personal KHQR code
5. If you can generate this, your account is enabled

**Option B: Register at Bank Branch**
1. Visit any ACLEDA bank branch
2. Request to **activate Bakong KHQR merchant receiving**
3. Provide your account number
4. They will enable KHQR receiving for your account

### Step 3: Get Your Correct Bakong ID

Your Bakong ID format must be **EXACT**:

```
Format: [phone_number]@[bank]
Example: 010925463@acleda
```

**To find your correct Bakong ID:**

1. Open ACLEDA Unity app
2. Go to **QR Code** â†’ **My QR Code**
3. Look for text like "Bakong ID" or scan your own QR code with another phone
4. The format should show: `0XXXXXXXXX@acleda`

### Step 4: Test Your Account

1. Get a friend to scan YOUR personal QR code from ACLEDA app
2. Have them try to send you a small amount (100áŸ›)
3. If it works, your account is properly set up
4. Copy that exact Bakong ID to your `.env` file

## Update Your .env File

Once you have your **correct and verified** Bakong ID:

```env
# Replace with YOUR actual verified Bakong ID
BAKONG_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT=010925463@acleda
```

**Important Notes:**

- The phone number should be the one registered with your ACLEDA account
- It must match EXACTLY what's in your Bakong profile
- The account must be **enabled to receive** KHQR payments

## Alternative: Use Different Bank

If ACLEDA doesn't work, try these banks that support personal KHQR:

```env
# Wing Bank
BAKONG_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT=010925463@wing

# ABA Bank  
BAKONG_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT=010925463@aba

# TrueMoney
BAKONG_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT=010925463@truemoney
```

âœ… Someone else can scan your personal QR and see your account
