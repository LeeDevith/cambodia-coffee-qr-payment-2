## 🔧 One More Step: Update Webhook (Important!)

Your Telegram bot currently has a webhook pointing to a different website. To make the confirmation buttons work, you need to update it:

### **Option 1: For Production (when deployed to Vercel/Netlify)**

After deploying your coffee shop website, run this command in your terminal or browser:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot8217877408:AAHWV9YflhWu2_m6v-ScAYgA-jT6p7Jmvgs/setWebhook" \
  -d "url=https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/api/telegram-webhook"
```

Replace `YOUR-DOMAIN.com` with your actual domain (e.g., `leefam-coffee.vercel.app`)

### **Option 2: For Local Testing (using ngrok)**

1. Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Run your development server: `npm run dev`
3. In a new terminal, run: `ngrok http 3000`
4. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
5. Set webhook:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot8217877408:AAHWV9YflhWu2_m6v-ScAYgA-jT6p7Jmvgs/setWebhook" \
  -d "url=https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/telegram-webhook"
```

### **Check Webhook Status Anytime:**

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot8217877408:AAHWV9YflhWu2_m6v-ScAYgA-jT6p7Jmvgs/getWebhookInfo"
```
